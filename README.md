this is my exquisite corpse

## THE STORY OF FUGO ##
My name is Fugo, Pannacotta Fugo.
I lived a happy life and I died with no *regrets*..
I hope I could find peace but I reincarnated as a cursed corpse..

I can live my second life as a reincarnated corpse. That's bad luck, but I accept it.  But why was it the cursed corpse of a *black cat*? What had I done to deserve that?

Ok, I confess I like to lick myself while people are staring at me with fascination. I also really appreciate to be rewarded for killing mouses. Most of all, I enjoyed watching my humans cleaning my toilet and serving my daily meals.
